# Nuber Eats

- The Backend of Nuber Eats Clone

## NestJS

- AppModule Everthing inside && Main.ts is runnning acutal app

  - Make a Module nest g mo "name"

- Refectoring "Reserver" is just doorman get a input send to service, get ouput and send to gql

## GraphQL API

- GraphQLModule.forRoot(), add on AppModule in the module import !

  - Get Error ! Caz need a Schema ! reserver and types !
  - CodeFirst - generate Schema
  - Using @Resolver for making resolver file and query as well (Decorator)
    - @Query Decorator needs to use as well
    - [How to Write Resolver? ](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/resolvers)

- Object Types

  - @ObjectType() and export class
  - @Field means every sigle data on shcema
    - nullable means ? ! on GraphQL

- Arguments

  - @Args('veganOnly') veganOnly: boolean write on resolver.ts

- Mutation

  - Using @Args decoratorts pass the args
    - ```
      @Args("argument : name") name :string
      ```
  - How about handle more than 2 args ?
    - @InputType() type of data wanna input one Object
      - ```
        @Filed(type=>String)\n name:string,
        ```
      - But this one needs dirty typing on graplql mutatin{crate(typename:{requried args })}
    - @ArgsType() Send to seperate value not put in a object !!
      - More Clean Code !

- Validating
  - npm i class-validator
  - add pipline on main.ts done
  - ```
    @IsEmail()
    @Field((type) => String)
    name: string;
    ```

## DataBase Configure

- To Talk to with database from nestJS/TS "ORM Coool to be nicer"

  - TYPE ORM "Mix with TS and nodeJS" (Object Realation Mapper)
  - Can support many platform

- PostgresSQL,Postico "use Home Brew to download"
- Connect Db with nestJS [Check Here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#database)

  - npm install --save @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg

- Using enviroment by [NestJS Configurations](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration)

  - Cross-env can use multiple enviroments
  - "start:dev": "cross-env ENV=dev nest start --watch", Setting Package.json file

- Most Powerful schema description language [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi)
  - How to use on NestJS? [Check Here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#schema-validation)
  - Give more security running my app

## TypeORM and Sent

- Entity is a class that maps to database table

  - @Entity for save data on db
  - @Field for GraphQL Schema
  - Wanna Edit Field ?
  - Just editting on specific module file

- Just add on TypeModule ,entiti as array

- [Active RecordðŸŽ„](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/active-record-data-mapper.md) vs [Data Mapper ðŸŽ„](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern)

- Mapped Types

## User Model

- 1. Create extends Modle ? Module

  - Don't want to repeat id part So Generate one more module for standard
  - extends other module , don't repeat them twice
  - [TypeORM Special Module](https://typeorm.io/#/entities/special-columns)

- 2. Create resolvers, service and Connect on Module

  - 1. Have to type on Imports in Module
       `imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],`
  - 2. Binding Repository in service
       `@InjectRepository(User) private readonly users: Repository<User>,`
  - 3. Binding service to User Resolver
       `constructor(private readonly userService: UsersService) {}
  - 4. Give a provider in Module` `providers: [UsersResolver, UsersService],`

### Create Account

- 3. Mutation and DTO

  - PrevSteps) entity make comfitable to graphQL as well
    - @ObjectType,@InputTtyp({isAbstract:true})
    - Write @Field Section on User Entity
  - PrevSteps) CoreEntity as well

  - Ready to Make a DTO

    ```
    @Mutation((returns) => CreateAccOutput)
    createAccount(@Args('input') createAccInput: CreateAccInput) {}
    ```

    - let them distinguish on input data and output data

      - Input

        - Use own Serviced by [nestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/mapped-types#pick)

      - Output
        - Make 2Fields For Error and Ok

- 4. EnumType

  - To DB try to write on Specific number
    - @Column({ type: 'enum', enum: UserRole })
  - Write on GrpahQL as well
    - registerEnumType(UserRole, { name: 'UserRole' });

- 5. CreateAcc on service.ts

  - createAcc has params type of CreateAccInput
  - this.somethig,save this.something.create different
    - can chain it for shorter lines (this.s.save(this.s.create({a,b,c})))

- 6. Hashing Password
  - Using by bcrypt on Entity before saving on database

### Login

- 7. Create reserver,service for login

  - create reserver for login
  - create service for login
  - expend user class for checking hashed password

- 8. Authentication

  - #### Manual Way

    - 1. Json WebToken [Go Check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)

      - Point is not to be secret
      - Valid fro backend verify who we are

    - 2. Create Module for jwt

      - nest g mo jwt
      - nest g s jwt
      - connect to on userService for using global set a decorator on jwt service

    - 3. make forRoot on Static service

    - 4. MiddleWare for getting token from user

      - Same like Express haritance from nextmiddleware use req,res,next
      - after function done have to add next() before closing bracket
      - App module implements nestmodule configure
      - consumer.apply(JwtMiddleware).forRoutes

      - If you wanna apply all routes ?

        - can use app.use(middleware name) on main.ts
        - Not working if you are using class

      - verify that token in headers
      - share the request graphql

        - set a user on header with decoded token
        - in grpahql module add context
        - can call it reservers anywhere @context

          - will call every signle request

        - guard will stop the reqeust [Guard](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards#guards)

## Email Verification

- Use one to one field

  - verifiy from email to User
  - Need to add JoinColumn on email section

- Generate random text

  - [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)

- Create Verification during create Acc

  - use save code and send user info
  - code ? from entity using beforeinsert "means before saving"

- Edit Profile as well when user changes the email ? need to re-verify email

- If i need to use relation data ? I have to ask typeorm for data

  - codecode.findOne({~},relation:["user"] or read something id will return id )

- OneToOne Field can set a what happend delete { onDelete: 'CASCADE' }

  - Like Django

- Select Flase on Entity so when i login, get error because password is undefined

  - Have to load from database when i call findone function { select: ['password'] } add this one as well

- email template ? suck Use the single email tempalte
  - MailGun or use nestjsEmail

## Test UserModel

- ### .spec.ts

  - Mandatory to testing
  - Unit Testing as much as possible isolate functions

  - 1. describe("UserServcie",function)
  - 2. it.todo(something what you want to test)
  - 3. beforeAll "Getting the service module and offer provider userservice"

  - 1. jest RootDir fixed on json
  - 2. Mock "fake function or class implementaion"

  - 1. Testing function not a outcome from a function

    - every single lines testing
    - Each line of code
    - How our code running
    - Don't care with real data and database

  - 2. Jest can Fake the module as well !

    - jest.mock("jsonwebtoken",fucntion) like this !!

- ### E2E Test

  - Error

    - 1. Cannot find module "need to configure path" in test folder
    - 2. Config Validation "NODE_ENV" Add on joi schema and copy and paste on env.test

  - Make for the test db

    - 1. configure on App module
    - 2. write on same varibles on .env.test
    - 3. make db manually
    - 4. Set afterAll(fn=>app.close())
    - 5. Open db and after testing drop the db make it clear

  - GraphQL reserver test

    - 1. import \* as request from 'supertest' because need to request and post some data
    - 2. request(app.getHttpServer) set a graphql end point and send query
    - 3. query: `` use Backtick it will allow you to use enter between backticks

  - Login Test

    - Make login case and wrong case test both of them
    - query as like graphql just copy from localhost
    - tobe , toEqual is different "check exact same output","Checking type"

  - UseProfile

    - Making a UserRepository
      - let userRepo: Repository<User>;
    - Get a user token from login test
    - const [user] = await userRepo.find();
      - userId = user.id;
    - Find first user and get the id beforeAll() testing in descrbie(userprofile)

  - Me
    - There's an bug on jwtMiddleware findbyid and it returs an object not a user
    - Use jwtToken which we got after loggin in

## Restaurant Model

- name, category, address, coverImage

  - [One to Many](https://typeorm.io/#/undefined/creating-a-many-to-one--one-to-many-relation)

  - @Inputtype can set a name

- ### Restaurant Create

  - <b>Create Restaurant</b>

    - Created Dto and check omittype to exclude id,category,owner
    - use PickType instead Omitting on Input
    - Add Category on Restaurant Module can use Category repository
    - Set Create NewRes and set a owner and catoegry

    - Create Decorator for Roles because don't wanna repeat if else a lot
      - !!Why Decorator ? for typeorm and graphql
      - AllowedRoles => type of enum's key,vaule
      - keyof typeof UserRoles and setMetadata("role",params)
    - AuthGuard Add on Globally
      - AuthModule add AppGuard as provider and useClass "AuthGurad"
      - add On App Module for using AuthGuard
      - Problems "Some query and mutation is public but is Locked by app guard"
        - Using Role decorator instead AuthGuard
        - check authguard can read roles data if is undefined? it means Public
        - on our guard handle if has a roles , roles has data handling retrun true

- ### Restaurant Read

  - <b>See Categories</b>

    - ComputeField Dynamic Field [ResolvField](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/resolverss)
    - Restaurant Count with Parent decorator

  - <b>See Restaurants by Category (Pagingation)</b>

    - pagination "Use Common Dto for doing pagination set a default = '1' "
    - [TypeOrm Find Where](https://typeorm.io/#/find-options/basic-options)

  - <b>See Restaurants (pagination)</b>

    - Call All restaurants [FindAndCount](https://typeorm.io/#/find-options)

  - <b>See Restaurant</b>

    - Get a Restaurant FindOne(with restaurant id)

  - <b>Search Restaurant</b>

- ### Restaurant Update

  - <b>Edit Restauarnt</b>
    - Make dto for PartialType make inputs Optional
    - [CoustomRepository](https://typeorm.io/#/custom-repositorys)

- ### Restaurant Delete

  - <b>Delete Restaurant</b>

## Dish

- Create Entity

  - Restaurant Can have Many dishes, Dish can Have one Restauarnt !!
  - So OneToMany and ManyToOne
  - Needs a Restaurant Id, Don't wanna load whole relationship
  - [Column Types](https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/entities#column-types)
    - Can give a Options !! "Can replace with one to many, many to one"
  - Make a New Resolver, add Provider

- ### Create Dish

  - CreateDish Dto Use Picktype([inner things]) required
  - Set a one Field For new restuarntId
  - Resolver ? Only Ower can make a Dish use decorator for owner, AuthUser to give owner info
  - service ? findOne by restaurantId, and add dish with json type how ?

    - Using Spread operation { ...createDishInput, restaurant }

- ### Edit Dish

  - Same as CreateDish but need to get restaurant "Use relations"
    - relations: ['restaurant'] can acess to restaurant like dishes.restaurant.ownerid like this

- ### Delete Dish

  - Same as EditDish

## Orders CRUD

- ### SetUp

  - Order Entity
    - User? Many To One why ? User can have bunch of orders but One order can have one User!
      - Need to figure out on userEntity and restaurantEntity as well
    - onDelete Set Null keeping the order, deliver
    - Dish ? [Many To Many](https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/many-to-many-relations)
      - @JoinTable() is required for @ManyToMany relations. You must put @JoinTable on one (owning) side of relation.
      - So where should put JoinTable ?
        - In Order Don't care how many orders dish got need to care how many orders not a how many dishes in this relation

- ### Create Order

  - OrderResolver and OrderService difined and Injected setting
  - #### Why Need OrderItem

    - When order created ? Finished on DishOption so don't need to care

    - While creating Order Entity don't need to care inverseWay

    - PickType fixed On Create-order.dto.ts ,add entity on app module

    - <b>Need to fix Bug "EverySingle Order need to pass DishInput ? Ridiculus"</b>

      - Don't use PickType, No need to get whole Dish need only Dish ID !
      - So create Coustom Object for InputType

    - How Powerful of Json tpe don't need to make new resolver,doto,service,entity

- ### Read Order
  - [] Pagination add it later
  - who can read order history ? [Owner, Customer, Deliver]
  - [Flat](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat)
  - Get-order
    - get input orderId and find order with relation restaurant why ? need to get restauarnt owner !
    - How to figure out customerId and diliveryId ? ,User RelationId on orderEntity
- ### Orders Subscription (Owner,Customer,Delivery)

  - Use npm [graphql-subscriptions](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions#readme)
  - Follow the Tutorial
  - This is Demo Version, check on [graphql-redis-subscriptions](https://github.com/davidyaha/graphql-redis-subscriptions)

    - 1. Error ("Could not connect to websocket endpoint ws://localhost:3000/graphql.")
      - installSubscriptionHandlers:true, on AppModule graphQlmodule
    - 2. Can't get a token jwtTokenMiddleware does not work on WS side

      - remove extends NestModule
      - get a token on http side and jwt side handle on AuthGuard , Graphql module

    - 3. Do JwtMiddleWare work on Auth Guard
    - 4. Get User each side(HTTP,WS)

  - Filter subscriptions [Check Here]("https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/subscriptions#filtering-subscriptions")

  - Pending Orders (Owner)
  - Order Status (Customer,Delivery,Owner)
  - Pending Pickup Order (Delivery)

    - eager relationship

- ### Payments (Cron Jobs)
